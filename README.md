## üìç Overview

Driver drowsiness is a **major cause of road accidents** globally. This project uses **real-time computer vision** and **deep learning** to monitor a driver's eye state and issue alerts if signs of fatigue are detected.

> Your seatbelt saves you during a crash.  
> This AI prevents it from happening.

## üìπ Demo Preview

![Preview of Detection](media/preview.png)

The system uses webcam feed to monitor the driver‚Äôs:
- Eye blinking rate
- Eye closure duration
- Yawning (optional upgrade)

If eyes remain closed beyond a safe threshold, an alarm is triggered to wake the driver.
